The Background of the story is a WR330v2 MT7621 board(a variant of youhua wr1200js) have broken Wifi part.
MT7603EN and MT7612E chip is damaged and has been removed by accident.
This board use SPI flash to boot and have a empty NAND part.
That empty NAND part is able to make a hardware MOD, add a SD card slot on it.
Then add a rtl8189es on SD card slot.
Due to the linux upstream not support rtl8188e with sdio interface hardware yet.
Need to compile vendor driver manually.


The Progress is:
Patch the OpenWRT wr1200js image to make it able to find SDIO device.
Compile rtl8189es realtek vendor driver to make wifi part work.





Unpack the OpenWRT image:

binwalk -e <Your OpenWRT image>

The test image build for a MT7621 board,with 'squashfs-sysupgrade.bin' ending.
file list:

XXXX.squashfs
40
40.7z

And it also show the firmware map:

0x0: u-boot legacy uImage header
0x40: a lzma compressed vmlinux and devicetree
0xXXX : a squashfs-root rootfs

Do Some modify:

The file 40 is include vmlinux and devicetree
Modify devicetree can support more board.
After modify , repack image is needed.


Reference: ` cat vmlinux xxxxx.dtb > 40 `


Then Repack image:
(Reference the build step)

Repack need tools:

lzma   --  from lzma-4.65.tar.bz2 /lzma-4.65/C/LzmaUtil/
mkimage   -- from u-boot tools
padjffs2  -- from OpenWRT source at tools/padjffs2/src

So Reference command is like:

cp ./40 ./kerneldtb
lzma e ./kerneldtb  -lc1 -lp2 -pb2 ./kerneldtb.lzma
# ( -lc1 -lp2 -pb2 may not use ?)
mkimage -A mips -O linux -T kernel -C lzma -a 0x80001000 -e 0x80001000 -n 'MIPS OpenWrt Linux-XXXX repack'  -d ./kerneldtb.lzma ./uimage
dd if=uimage  >> upgrade.bin
dd if=XXXXXX.squashfs  >> upgrade.bin
padjffs2  upgrade.bin   4 8 16 64 128 256



NOTE: Don't need to assign signature for repacked image.


Compile rtl8189es progress can reference make rtl8822bs driver part.
